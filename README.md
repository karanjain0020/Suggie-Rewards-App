List of C# naming conventions. Also follows Microsoft .NET C# coding guidelines
https://github.com/ktaranov/naming-convention/blob/master/C%23%20Coding%20Standards%20and%20Naming%20Conventions.md

Code Conventions
Layout and Spacing:
* Indents = 4 space
* Write only one statement per line
* Write only one declaration per line

Commenting:
* Put comments on a separate line, not at the end of a line of code
* Begin comment text with an uppercase letter
* End comment text with a period
* Insert one space between the comment delimiter (//) and the comment text, as shown in the following example
	// This is a good comment

Naming:
* PascalCasing for class names and method names
* camelCasing for method arguments and local variables
* Don’t use Hungarian notation or any other type identification in identifiers  
   * Ex:  string name; not string strName;
* Don’t use SCREAMING CAPS for constants or readonly variables
* Use meaningful names for variables

Process

The process we plan to implement was inspired by smarbear.com. A direct link is: https://smartbear.com/learn/code-review/best-practices-for-peer-code-review/ . 

* Review fewer than 200 lines of code at a time. 
* The brain cannot effectively process more than this.
* Take your time. Your inspection rate should be under 500 lines of code per hour. 
  * Increases effectiveness
* Don’t review for more than an hour at a time.
  * Taking a break can help mental acuteness
* Set goals and capture metrics
*  As a group we will see how effective our peer reviews are. From this observation we can keep track of our effectiveness and make changes on our process based on that. 
* We can also set goals to have a specific amount of support calls so one person is not helping someone too much. This is just one example of setting goals.
* Annotate source code before review. This should also be apart of the coding convention as mentioned before. 
* Use a checklist. 
* Reduces similar errors in code between members
* Provides a way to keep track of what to do
* Establish process to fix defects
* Possible process is to share the defect with the author of code in a checklist format maybe, then get your suggestions to fix * defects approved or disproved by the author 
* Foster positive code review environment
* Look at bugs and defects as opportunity for improvement
* Teaching is more powerful than judging 
* Embrace your subconscious implication of peer review
* Someone will be looking at your code, so put your best work out there
* Practice lightweight code reviews 
  * Takes less time 
* Quick text or email can be faster than a formal code review
